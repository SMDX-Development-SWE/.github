# Welcome to SMDX Development!

<!--
- SMDX Development is a development team focusing on LUA development on the FiveM scene.
We started out on May 2024 and since that we have been working hard to keep pushing optimized, functional and appropriate scripts
for the FiveM scene. We are mainly focused on the QBCore Framework but we also have knowledge in ESX.
